    <p> specifications of the system from logical
        design are transformed into the
        technology-specific details from which all
        programming and system construction can
        be accomplished. An approach to systems development
        based on building complete systems
        through assembling software

        <h3>DataBase</h3>
    <p>A database system (DBS) is a computerized record keeping system with the overall purpose of maintaining information and making it available whenever required. The database typically stores related data in a computer system.
        Client/server architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts,
        delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed
        by the client. This type of architecture has one or more client computers
        connected to a central server over a network or internet connection. This
        system shares computing resources.

    <h3>Advantage of a database system</h3>
    <p>Client/server architecture is also known as a networking computing model or
        client/server network because all the requests and services are delivered
        over a network
